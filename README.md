# SNAKE -The Game-

Simple Snake game, created just with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Every concept learnt throughout this small game, were given by @Reboot Academy, and applied by myself.

#### Things to add afterwards, not necessary but nice to add : \
- Let the snake move between sides (left-right-up-down), as in an infinite loop, creating the effect of the snake being inside a globe.
- If snake touches itself, it dies. 
- For each apple eaten, increase snake's speed by X amount (X to be defined)
